# dectalk

A reimplementation of the DECtalk software API in Go.

DECtalk was created by Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1990s, then sold to Force Computers in 2000 and later Fonix Corporation, which changed its name to SpeechFX. All of these companies are gone, but the DECtalk voices are still very recognizable, having been used by Stephen Hawking, the National Weather Service, and several video games, among others.
